  var a = (currentyr - 1)/ 4;
  var b = (currentyr - 1)/ 100;
  var c = (currentyr - 1)/ 400;
  var daystart = (currentyr + a - b + c)%7;

this is the concept to calculate the day start  with the help of currentyr 

 i  am trying to make calendar without using date object  

 one thing is missing  :-i don't set the date accordingly to days .
